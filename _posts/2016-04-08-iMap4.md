After nearly 6 months of review and revision, iMap4 is finally accepted in Behavioral Research Methods!  

```Lao, J., Miellet, S., Pernet, C., Sokhn, N., & Caldara, R. (in press). iMap4: An Open Source Toolbox for the Statistical Fixation Mapping of Eye Movement data with Linear Mixed Modeling. Behavior Research Methods.```

We got some very good (and some of them quite difficult) comments from an anonymous reviewer and Simon Barthelm√© (he signed his own review, much respect!)

You can get the toolbox [here](http://ibmlab.github.io/iMap4/), or visit the [project page](https://github.com/iBMLab/iMap4) for more information. Detail documentations could be found in the [iMap4 wiki](https://github.com/iBMLab/iMap4/wiki).

We might add a few more features for importing data and data visualization in the future, but the modeling procedure would likely remain. I am actively pursuing the Bayesian approach and generative model now for eye movement analysis, I think opening a new project would be more appropriate.

Until then, please try iMap4 and let me know what you think!
