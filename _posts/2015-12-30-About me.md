I am Junpeng Lao, currently a postdoc in the Department of Psychology at the University of Fribourg.

My PhD thesis is about the modulation of high-level social inferences (i.e., Culture) on low-level perception. The technique I applied including eye tracking, EEG, and fMRI.

I am currently interested in Bayesian reasoning and machine learning, especially the application of these methods in naturalistic paradigm.
